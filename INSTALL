Installation instructions for Quban - a Qt usenet binary news grabber 

Version 0.7.2 - 3rd July 2015

Dependencies:
 - Qt 4.6 or greater (libqt4-devel, qt4-devel, etc)
 - Berkeley Db 4.x  or 5.x (libdb-cxx-devel, libdb5.1++-dev, etc)  
   (http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/database/berkeleydb/overview/index.html) 
   with C++ support. If you compile it from source, remember to  pass the 
   "--enable-cxx" option to configure (see below).
- zlib version 1

* How to compile:

- You can grab the source from sourceforge (go to
http://quban.sourceforge.net/). It compiles as follows:

  cp Quban_0.7.2.tar.gz <your chosen installation dir>
  cd <your chosen installation dir>
  tar zxvf Quban_0.7.2.tar.gz
  cd Quban_0.7.2  
  qmake -recursive CONFIG+=release Quban.pro
  make

If the above steps successfully create the quban executable then either dive in 
and try it straight away or read the README file for details about getting started...

The following are the most common reasons for a problem (in my experience):

 problem - qmake was not found
solution - Try replacing qmake with /usr/lib/qt4/bin/qmake or run 'find' to discover where qmake resides 

 problem - Qt4 Development package is not installed
solution - use yum, apt-get, yast etc to install the appropriate package, called something like libqt4-devel 

 problem - Berkeley C++ development package is not installed
solution - use yum, apt-get, yast etc to install the appropriate package, called something like libdb-cxx-devel  

 problem - zlib Development package is not installed
solution - use yum, apt-get, yast etc to install the appropriate package, called something like zlib-devel or zlib1g-dev 

 problem - You can't find a Berkeley C++ development package for your distribution
solution - If you find a version that doesn't mention C++ take a look at it's contents. On Mandriva 64 the 
           package lib64db5.1-devel-5.1.25 contains the required files (db_cxx.h and libdb_cxx.so).

 problem - You still can't find a Berkeley C++ development package for your distribution
solution - Download the latest source version and install as follows:

 - Go to http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/database/berkeleydb/downloads/index.html and download the
   latest version without encryption. Currently "Berkeley DB 5.2.36.NC.tar.gz , without encryption (32M)".
 - cp db-5.2.36.NC.tar.gz <your chosen installation dir>
 - cd <your chosen installation dir>
 - tar zxvf db-5.2.36.NC.tar.gz
 - cd db-5.2.36.NC/build_unix
 - ../dist/configure --enable-cxx
 - make
 - make install (as root, sudo)
 - cd /usr/local
 - ln -s BerkeleyDB.5.2 BerkeleyDB (as root, sudo) this is required so that the Quban build finds the files
 - at runtime invoke the following before calling quban: 
   export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:/usr/local/BerkeleyDB/lib
   or look at ldconfig...
   This last step is required so that Quban finds the Berkeley library at runtime.

I've successfully run Quban using various versions, between 4.8 and 5.2, of BerkeleyDB. As Quban is based 
upon Klibido it should run against even earlier versions, back to 4.2 (if you need to use them).

Good luck!
